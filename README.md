**Messy fork of the original mod to support some content mods. I made it last year, but now I'll try to update some things and finally share it with the world. 
I'm not really a good coder, so it's mostly complicated if statements, but I didn't notice any performance hits or crashes.**

# Mods supported
- Ortalab
- Maximus (currently broken)
- Redux Arcanum
- Revirie (Alters mod's intended behaviour for crazy packs by allowing to use some straightaway)
- ArtBox
- UnStable
- Sacrpot (Need testing)
- Lucky Rabbit (Need testing)

Currently I need to fix negative consumables in packs, they should ignore slot limit.

Merged @TinyDerp's pull to add config to hide action buttons.


# Sticky Fingers

A mod that brings "touch" controls to Balatro on PC/Mac, making it a bit more fun to play on desktop and improving the experience on touch-based PCs like the Steam Deck! The default mouse controls are kept intact.
